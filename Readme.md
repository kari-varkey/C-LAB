#C lab - Programs on functions (Menu driven Included!!)

#Why This repo?
This repo has been made for quick access onto the source code for the C Programming lab class.
##Isn't this unnecessary?
Probably, but this helps me to learn how to properly use GitHub and it's services properly!
Including my website [Portfolio](karivarkey.github.io)

> Warning!! Do not use this code for output verification. It can result in serious offensive punishments and I will not be help liable!

##Included programs

- [x] Find the factorial of a given natural number ‘N’ using recursive and non-recursive
      functions.
- [x] Read a string (word), store it in an array and obtain its reverse by using a user defined
      function.
- [x] Write a menu driven program for performing matrix addition, multiplication and finding
      the transpose. Use functions to
      (i) read a matrix
      (ii) find the sum of two matrices
      (iii) find the product of two matrices
      (iv) find the transpose of a matrix
      (v) display a matrix.
